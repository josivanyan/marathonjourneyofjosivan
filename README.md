I embedded several links in this website and you can visit all the official websites of them, hope everyone would enjoy my marathon journey.

When you hover your mouse over each city in the 'Next Destinations' section, the name of the city turns green. I chose this color because it represents the meaning of my Chinese name, even though it may not match the overall theme of the website. However, the links to the official website of each city can be accessed by clicking on either the picture or the text below it.
